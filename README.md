This is a draft landing page for PrivateUpgrades.

Background:
----------------------------------------------------
We are looking for ways to get better conversions from our Google ads to signups and then hotel bookings.  The idea is to have an intro video, then the member signs up, after which a "how to" video will display showing them how to use the site.

Technology:
----------------------------------------------------
This uses HTML and the Semantic UI CSS library.
